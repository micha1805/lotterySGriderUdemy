# simple lottery

Simple lottery in solidity.

It' using pseudo random number. Chainlink VRF would be a better option, but that's how this example is made.


You need the following `.env` file to make it work :


```bash
MNEMONICS='12 random words to generate your account'
INFURA_ENDPOINT="https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID"

```
